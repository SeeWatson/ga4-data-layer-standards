# Form Error

Fire whenever a user unsuccessfully completes a form. 

This is in contrast to `form_complete` which occurs when a submission succeeds.

## Javascript Code

```js

window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
dataLayer.push({
  event: 'form_error',
  eventModel: {
    category: '<category>',
    count_form_error: 1,
    error_message: '<error_message>',
    identifier: '<identifier>',
    name: '<name>',
    type: '<type>'
  }
});
```

|category|string|recommended|A human-readible identifier whose purpose will vary by event, but generally is used to group things (forms, links, videos) into loose assocations based upon shared characteristics. If running low on custom dimensions, you may combine multiple categories together in this field, separated by greater than (>) or slash (/). See https://schema.org/category.|Registration Form|

|name|string|required|The form human-readable name. This should be something that an analyst without a deep knowledge of the technical implementation of the site can easily identify the form with. It should be lowercase snake_case if possible.|event_registration_form|
|type|string|recommended|The type of error that occurred.|form_field_validation, server_error|
